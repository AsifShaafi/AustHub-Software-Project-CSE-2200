There were some issues with CGPA calculations as there is not enough information in our AUST website. We have shown the course credit below each subject name if were any corrections please do inform us.

We have added all the routines of all department except ARCH but the other features will work fine. We will try to upload them as soon as possible you wont need to install or update your app again for that.

We are still working on some new features. Please do leave a feedback & If you have any suggestions for us please do leave a suggestions as well.
